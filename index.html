        <h2><b>Thoughts on My People and the Beautiful Future</b></h2>

        <p>I woke up feeling odd today. Sad, but maybe not sad. I dream about the same man every night, and last night he ignored me in my dreams. It’s odd, but these energetic interactions affect my night, affect my day.</p> 

        <p>So here I am. I make instant coffee, a favorite Argentinian brand of my friend’s dad. He drank it when he visited, she gave it to me after he left. I’m almost out. She left for Argentina this morning and, perfect timing, I think. I’ll ask her to bring some back for me.</p>

        <p>I turn on the YouTube channel I am embarrassed to watch, but watch religiously. I don’t like the word “religiously”, and it’s probably not the right word anyway. I watch it regularly, not because I buy into it, necessarily. But it helps me capture my own magic.</p>

        <p>This morning, I need it. Because often, I find magic in my sleep. I find myself pulled into energies, healing and learning during my unconscious hours. I dream off to different realities, or maybe it is always the same reality. It is beautiful and warm, a place of love and depth, and I am at a point where I don’t know, it could exist somewhere, but I know that it exists inside of me.</p>

        <p>It was the focal point of my psychotic experience, which from where I am now, doesn’t seem to be psychotic at all. It is a place of energetic balance, of love without fear, without possession, without control. It is enhancing the positive and healing the negative, it is creativity, it is collaboration, it is beauty. The Beautiful Future, I called it. And I believed in it. Call me crazy, call me whatever you want, but fuck it, I still do. Because sure, it’s a long shot, but believing is the only way to make impossible things possible.</p>

        <p>The Beautiful Future is not a place, but a feeling. I try to stay there most of the time, but it is hard. I float around this city and sometimes it feels like delusion, I feel like I’m pretending, so I pull my consciousness back to the energy of the current reality and wow. I feel the difference. If you’d ever been to the Beautiful Future, you’d know what I mean. I am lucky to know it, but it makes the Less-Than-Beautiful Present feel worse than before. I know I have to live here now but sometimes I wish that I didn’t, some days I just can’t stand it.</p>

        <p>Things are bad now. And I am learning to balance. To live in the energy of the Beautiful Future without deluding myself about the present. To know why it is what it is, without needing to explain it to everyone. The problem is that knowing why it is what it is makes it extremely bearable, makes everything make sense, to the point where being okay makes me look stupid and crazy. So I find myself pulled into lower energies, getting angry about things I know aren’t worth my energy. Breath it out. Remember. Recenter.</p>

        <p>Things are bad and everyone wants a voice. Everyone wants a voice but no one really knows what they’re talking about, and so the energy of my people is the energy of a bunch of idiots shouting at each other without looking at themselves. Rehashing their own trauma while forgetting the rule of trauma: unless you heal, the traumatized becomes the traumatizer.</p>

        <p>My people. This is something I grapple with. I grapple with the beliefs, I grapple with the culture, I grapple with the idea that they are mine. Because my thoughts and feelings are not aligned with theirs anymore, and I know how this works. You are theirs, conditionally. You are theirs, as long as you agree, support, validate validate validate. Validate their fear, validate their anger, validate their hatred. Validate their superiority and warped self-image. But if you are critical of anything, even from the inside, you become an outsider. Self-hating traitor to your people. And they do not even notice the ways they eat propaganda for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, the ways they are victims only of themselves and God. You are theirs, as long as you obey. You are theirs, as long as you agree. You are theirs, as long as you make them look good. But once you form your own opinion, you are cast aside and forgotten.</p>

        <p>My energy is angry at them. My heart hardens with rejection, I am not yours, you are not mine, you are all playing the victim while acting like the villain, you are all blind to your own power and privilege, you are fetishizing your own trauma to look sympathetic, you think you are defending the right to exist but you are actually defending the right to oppress. I have come at it from the inside, I know what I’m talking about. Still, my own sister hurls insults at me, and I wobble. I remind myself: this is what the narcissist does, responds to critical feedback by causing you to question your perception of reality, clings to narratives of victimhood and heroism in order to avoid any true self-reflection.</p>

        <p>My people are steeped in narcissistic beliefs. In some ideas of victimhood and superiority, a culture of exclusivity and rejection, and total misunderstanding of energetic dynamics. We replay out all our historical trauma over drawn-out meals. We are reminded and reminded and reminded, to trust no one who is not like us, to expect rejection. If they seem like they like you, they are lying. They are going to betray you, they always have, they always will.</p>

        <p>My people once felt weak, powerless, unprotected. My people felt vulnerable in all places, at all times. So my people got their own place, built their own country, organized their own military. They created what they sought to create, propaganda machine and all. And now they are strong and powerful and protected, but their stories haven’t caught up. They still think of themselves as victims, even though they are not.</p>

        <p>All people are my people, but these are mine. I thought to leave them, to call myself my own, to reject them as someone else’s problem. But I will not leave them, I will not let them disown me, I will not let them fall victim to their own unhealed trauma. I will hug them as they hit me, I will understand them before they do. I will call them my people, because I can only heal through acceptance and love. I will call them my people, because my love — unlike theirs — is unconditional. I will call them my people, because I will not abandon them for the ways they hurt themselves and others. I will call them my people, even though they would no longer call me theirs.</p>

        <p>My people are in crisis. A crisis of identity and self-awareness. My people are so used to being victims that they cannot see that they have become villains. But I know how energy works, I know that inside of every villain is a victim, I know that no being can see another’s pain and continue to cause it. You may disagree, but this is my definition of evil (one who sees, truly sees, another’s pain and continues to joyfully cause it), and I know in my soul that evil does not exist. I know that my people are not bad people, that they only misguided. And so, I breath out the anger. I hug and hold them as they kick and scream and publicly shout about the traumas that they joke about in private. I see them, I see this, I do like it, but I love it, too. I love it, because it is the only way to heal it.</p>

              <h2><b>My Insides All Out in the Open</b></h2>

                <p>Something sits inside me, sad. And I know I have to look. I know I have to figure it out.</p>

                <p>It is all of this. I have unraveled the lies, and I see so many liars. I am angry, I am. It permeates my energy, and it is not a feeling but a becoming. I do not feel anger, I become it. </p>

                <p>I try to center myself. I come back to center. And it is only for a brief moment, but for a brief moment I am in my own life, in my own head. I hold the feeling and study it. I look to plant it and grow it. I am here. I am now. I exist for me.</p>

                <p>So, suddenly I am in San Francisco. I am in San Francisco and San Francisco is in me. The whole of me feels here, in this life, and this feels good but for some reason it is hard to do. Because my energy is a helium balloon, flying up and away, and I am here holding the string, pulling it back, asking it to please, please, just be here now. Grounding comes in quick sweet flahses before it yanks me up again.</p>

                <p>But when I am here, I am beautiful. I see me and I see my life, a woman who thinks of herself as a girl, who skips around the city smiling at strangers and befriending local business owners. Who fills her home with her energy, who loves creative projects, who seriously can’t stop buying plants. A grandmother to a yet-to-be-determined number of newborn slugs (Cinderella must have felt lonely all by herself). Who loves children’s cartoons and thrifted clothes, who creates things offline, who creates for the sake of creation. A person who always looks at herself first, who thinks and feels and writes and writes and writes. Who knows her values, who knows her boundaries, who is fully committed to herself. This whole girl, with a whole life. Sometimes it is hard to see yourself and be yourself.</p>

                <p>I know how to do this, I know what to do. I have done the hard work, I have looked at the whole world, I have analyzed the energy. I know who I am. I know how I feel. I know it, and yet, I am still solidifying myself. Still trying to turn that stinkin balloon into a seed.</p>

                <p>Okay. But fine. Stay here, Molly. Stay in this life. This is where you are. This is where you want to be.</p>

                <p>This is where I want to be. For a long time, I entertained the idea of other places. Tel Aviv, the one who got away. But now it is clear, I have outgrown her. I loved her for a moment, but I was never meant to have her.</p>

                <p>She was never meant to have me. I am too big for her now. I could not fit my full self in her claustrophobic embrace. She asks me to conform, and I will not. She asks me to fit her mold, but I will not compromise my shape. I still love her, but I see her. She is not for me right now, and that is okay.</p>

                <p>And San Francisco is not perfect but at least she knows herself. No one here pretends to love the outrageous rent or housing crisis, no one here acts like these problems are not problems. But for all her superficial imperfections, San Francisco has made me a better person. Because she does not ask me to be anyone but me, to heal myself, to love myself, to not be a dick to other people. And so long as I do that, I can walk topless down the street, I can camp out in a park, I can go to sex parties or meditation groups or whatever the fuck makes me feel like me. San Francisco is where I found myself.</p>

                <p>I did not come here searching for me. Or not in the way I found me, at least. I escaped the suburbs with a partner, and we expected San Francisco life to be like any other city life. We were young and, unbeknownst to us, mildly racist. And we spent years running around with the egos that complain about this place, because they are scared of unhoused folks and the streets are dirty and the restaurants aren’t good and there isn’t a nightlife, before I learned how to love it for what it is instead of denigrating it for what it isn’t, before I decided to make myself a part of it and let this city into my soul.</p>

                <p>I am here. I am now. I am home. I am in my own energy and mind and apartment. I tidy up this sunlit studio and I vacuum the mess. I sit down and I plan my plant group and this website and I think, think, think, and I’ve finally stopped thinking about what’s hurting (because nothing hurts much these days) and I just visualize what I want. I follow my own energy back to myself, and I see me here, connecting with my friends and making new ones, writing whatever the fuck I want on this little site that no one reads. I put myself here and I fill myself with love, and I am me and I imagine all the ways I want to be myself.</p>

            <date>October 30, 2023</date>
            <h2><b>Welcome to my Internal World</b></h2>

                <p>Okay. Okay. Okay okay okay.</p>

                <p>Here’s the thing. This place. This place is for me. It is mine and you are welcome here, but these are my thoughts, my feelings, and I do not care what you think or feel about them. That is why I’ve chosen to create this place. Because I want to express, because I want to be available for connection, but I do not want to seek your attention, I do not want to ask for it.</p>
                <p>I thought about this a lot. Of course. How did I want to do it and why? Or maybe more accurately, what energy do I want to give it and how? But before I thought, I felt, I found the feeling that I wanted from this. And then I looked at everything it would take to create that, and anything that would take me further from it.</p>
                <p>I wanted this to be mine. To be my place, for me, by me. And I am not big on technology (yes) but I am also all for autonomy, for expression without concession. So fine. I’ll put it online.</p>
                <p>But this is sort of an homage to the internet of yore. The early World Wide Web of creativity and innocence, of sharing for the sake of sharing, pre ads and commerce and capital worming its way into every crack and crevice. It is my space, where I can be myself, with eyes captivated but not captive. You are here because you came here, because you wanted to be here. You have sought me out for whatever reason, but I have not asked or expected or demanded that you come here.</p>
                <p>This is a space for my soul, my authentic self, my true expression. My world is magical, but I feel lonely. To understand my reality means accepting a million truths that feel like nonsense, mean allowing for possibilities that seem impossible. And it is not exactly that I want to be understood, though I do, but that I want to understand myself, all the energy I’ve mined and experienced and catalogued. It is not even that I want to understand myself as much as I want to express it, all the ways I see energy grow and shift and change within me, how I learn to reshape myself and to hold my shape amongst all those people and ideas that pull at my form, that push to reform me.</p>
                <p>I have always loved to write. I have always felt like a writer. And I have struggled and wrestled and fought with the identity, I have wondered whether I could call myself a writer even though I rarely publish. But writing is about writing. And I write.</p>
                <p>Because writing is where I find myself. Here I am me, fully me, expressed in my entirety without the shackles of your expectations, without the effects of your energy. This is my true form, this is who I am when you can’t see me. And yes, sometimes I think of you as my fingers tap the keyboard, sometimes I find myself speaking to something you might be thinking. But then I delete it. I am not writing for you. I am writing for me.</p>
                <p>I am here for me. I am writing for me. I have created this for me. Welcome to my internal world.</p>
